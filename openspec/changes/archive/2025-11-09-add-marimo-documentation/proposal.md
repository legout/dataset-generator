# Change: Add Marimo Examples Documentation

## Why
The project includes marimo example files in the `examples/marimo/` directory but lacks comprehensive documentation to help users understand and use these examples effectively. Adding proper documentation will improve discoverability and adoption of marimo notebooks as an alternative to traditional Jupyter notebooks.

## What Changes
- Add comprehensive documentation for marimo examples similar to existing Jupyter documentation
- Document setup instructions for marimo environment
- Explain differences and advantages of marimo vs Jupyter notebooks
- Include code examples and best practices specific to marimo notebooks
- Reference the existing marimo example files: `ecommerce_overview.py` and `ecommerce_overview_dl.py`

## Impact
- Affected specs: documentation
- Affected code: docs/examples/marimo.md (new file)
- Improved user experience for marimo notebook users
- Better alignment between Jupyter and marimo documentation
