## 1. Gap Assessment
- [x] 1.1 List every nav entry that points to a missing file (tutorials, development, troubleshooting)
- [x] 1.2 Inventory broken internal links reported by MkDocs
- [x] 1.3 Confirm which assets (`logo`, `favicon`, etc.) are missing on disk

## 2. Content Authoring
- [x] 2.1 Write initial versions of the three tutorial pages (E-commerce dataset, S3 with MinIO, Custom Generator)
- [x] 2.2 Create `development/architecture.md` and `development/testing.md` with current-state information
- [x] 2.3 Add `user-guide/troubleshooting.md` covering common build/runtime issues

## 3. Assets & Links
- [x] 3.1 Restore `docs/assets/logo.png` (plus any other referenced assets) in the correct resolution
- [x] 3.2 Fix relative links (e.g., `../user-guide/generators/`) so MkDocs recognizes them
- [x] 3.3 Run `mkdocs build` to ensure no warnings remain about missing files or assets
