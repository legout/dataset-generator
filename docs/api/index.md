# API Reference

The API reference is generated automatically from the docstrings that live in
`src/dataset_generator`. Use the navigation on the left to browse packages,
modules, classes, and functions. Each entry includes signatures, parameter and
return types, and a link back to the source code.

!!! tip
    If a symbol you expect to see is missing, rebuild the docs locally with
    `mkdocs build`. The API tree mirrors the Python modules, so make sure the
    module is publicly exported and has an up-to-date docstring.
